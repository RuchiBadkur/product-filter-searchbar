### What I learned

My major learnings while working through this project are:

- javascript DOM manipulation techniques.

```css
    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, black, aqua);
    overflow: scroll;
    .container::-webkit-scrollbar{
    display: none;
}
    
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on learning web development technologies like html, css, bootstrap, javascript, react.js, node.js, express.js and database like mongodb etc. in future projects.

### Useful resources
